# IronPdf Function Test Solution
Trying to get IronPdf working inside a Azure function.
Not working. When I run get the following:

  HResult=0x80004003
  Message=Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.
  Source=<Cannot evaluate the exception source>
  StackTrace:
